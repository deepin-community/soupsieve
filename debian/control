Description: modern CSS selector implementation for BeautifulSoup (Python 3)
 Soup Sieve is a CSS selector library designed to be used with Beautiful Soup 4
 (python3-bs4 in Debian). It aims to provide selecting, matching, and filtering
 using modern CSS selectors. Soup Sieve currently provides selectors from the
 CSS level 1 specifications up through the latest CSS level 4 drafts (though
 some are not yet implemented).
 .
 Soup Sieve was written with the intent to replace Beautiful Soup's builtin
 select feature, and as of Beautiful Soup version 4.7.0, it now is ðŸŽŠ. Soup
 Sieve can also be imported in order to use its API directly for more
 controlled, specialized parsing.
 .
 This package contains Soup Sieve for Python 3.x.
